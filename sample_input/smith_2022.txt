TITLE: Accuracy of a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic adults

========================
METHODS – STUDY SETTING
========================
The study was conducted at a tertiary-care hospital inpatient service between March and June 2022.

========================
METHODS – PARTICIPANTS
========================
All eligible patients presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during the study period were enrolled consecutively. Patients were excluded if informed consent could not be obtained.

========================
METHODS – INDEX TEST
========================
The index test was a commercially available rapid antigen assay. Test results were interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions for use. The positivity threshold specified by the manufacturer was applied.

========================
METHODS – REFERENCE STANDARD
========================
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the reference standard for confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection. PCR results were interpreted by laboratory staff blinded to the index test results.

========================
METHODS – PROCEDURES
========================
Index testing and PCR sampling were performed during the same clinical encounter.

========================
RESULTS – PARTICIPANT FLOW
========================
A total of 412 patients were enrolled. Of these, 63 participants were excluded from the final analysis due to missing PCR results.
